Known Problems in Release 2.2.1
-------------------------------

* In test/validate, pvAssignStress.st has the same program name as
  pvAssignSubst.st, leading to build errors when cross-compiling to VxWorks
  or RTEMS, where all tests get linked into a single library. This can be
  fixed by changing the program name in pvAssignStress.st to
  "pvAssignStressTest".

* A previous bugfix in the pvAssign builtin introduced a regression, that
  can lead to assertion failures. The code repository contains a fix.
