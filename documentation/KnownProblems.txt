Known Problems in Release 2.2.1
-------------------------------

* In test/validate, pvAssignStress.st has the same program name as
  pvAssignSubst.st, leading to build errors when cross-compiling to VxWorks
  or RTEMS, where all tests get linked into a single library. This can be
  fixed by changing the program name in pvAssignStress.st to
  "pvAssignStressTest".

* A previous bugfix in the pvAssign builtin introduced a regression, that
  can lead to assertion failures.

* Building static libraries fails due to wrong order of dependent libraries
  in two Makefiles.

* Tests fail in tests/compiler if the build host has an ancient version of
  Testy::More that does not support subtest. This happens e.g. on RHEL 6.6.
