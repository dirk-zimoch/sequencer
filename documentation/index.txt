A note about font sizes
-----------------------

Many browers, most notably firefox but many others, too, come with default
preference settings that give monospaced fonts a smaller size than other
fonts. If the documentation pages look ugly to the point of unreadability in
your browser because font sizes jumping around wildly, I suggest you set the
font sizes in your browser's preferences menu all to the same value and send
a complaint  to the maintainers of your browser. I refuse to include brittle
work-arounds in my style sheet to compensate for these ridiculously
out-dated default settings.
