   sequencer

      #. The project that defines `SNL` and provides an implementation.
      #. The runtime library that supports execution of `SNL` `program`\s.

   cpp

      The C preprocessor. Normally not a stand-alone program but part of the
      C compiler. Can be abused to preprocess `SNL` code, too, which is a
      constant source of compatibility problems.

   snc

      The `SNL` compiler. See `Compiling`.

   SNL

      State Notation Language. What this project is about.

   assigned

      The property of a variable or array element to occur in an `assign`
      clause in an `SNL` `program`.

   event flag

      An abstract data type predefined in SNL, similar to a semaphore. See
      `Event Flags` for a more detailed description.

   PV
   process variable

      A mutable variable that is globally visible and accessible via some
      network protocol in a distributed control system, such as one based on
      `EPICS`. PVs are identified by their name, which must be unique.

   anonymous channel

      Pseudo `channel`\s for communication between state sets inside the
      same instance of a running SNL program. Can be thought of as a
      `channel` to an `anonymous PV`. Available only in `safe mode`, see
      `Anonymous Channels`.

   anonymous PV

      Conceptually something like a "virtual" unnamed `PV`. These do not
      really exist, but are a useful fiction when thinking about `anonymous
      channel`\s.

   channel

      In general, a connection that allows communication (read, write,
      monitor) with a `process variable`. In SNL this term is also used for
      variables (or parts of them) that have a pv type, so they can be
      `assign`\ed to a `PV`.

   CA
   Channel Access

      The `EPICS` network protocol, used to connect client programs to
      `PV`\s hosted on a server.

   EPICS

      Experimental Physical and Industrial Control System. A set of tools
      and libraries for building large distributed soft real-time control
      systems.

   state set

      `SNL` jargon for finite state machine. A program may contain multiple
      state sets and each runs in its own thread.

   true

      Any non-zero value, as in C.

   false

      Zero, as in C.
